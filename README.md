# Cyclic Chain of Oscillators with Vibro-Impact NESs

The tool CC (prononunced Sisi) performs various numerical and analytical investigations of a Cyclic Chain (CC) of Oscillators with Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sinks (VI-NESs) under harmonic standing/traveling wave forcing.

All simulations are started from the `CC.m` file that reads in the specfied configuration file from the configuration folder. There you can already find some examples that were shown in the corresponding paper. When setting up a new configuration file, you first need to set which simulation you want to perform and then specifiy the parameters needed for the simulation. A list of all parameters and some useful default values can be found in the `InitStructs.m` file in the system folder.

**If you are using CC for your own studies, please refer to the paper:**

_Note that the CC is currently being extended to model the effects of random disorder._
