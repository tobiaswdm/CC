# Cyclic Chain of Oscillators with Vibro-Impact NESs

This tool is performs various numerical and analytical investigations of a Cyclic Chain of Oscillators with Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sinks (VI-NESs) under harmonic standing/traveling wave forcing.

All simulations are started from the 'main.m' file that reads in the specfied configuration file from the configuration folder. When setting up a configuration file, you first need to set which simulation you want to perform and then specifiy the parameters needed for the simulation. A list of all parameters and some useful default values can be found in the 'InitStructs.m' file in the system folder.

If you are using the code for your studies, please refer to the paper:

T. Weidemann, L.A. Bergman, A.F. Vakakis, M. Krack. (2024). "Energy Transfer and Localization in a Forced Cyclic Chain of Oscillators with Vibro-Impact Nonlinear Energy Sinks". Manuscript submitted to Nonlinear Dynamics

Note that the current is currently extended to model the effects of random disorder.
